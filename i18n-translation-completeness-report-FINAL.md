## Previous Report Issues

### Initial Report (False Positives)

The initial report showed **1,853 "missing" keys**, but these were **false positives** caused by:

1. **Array Structure Misinterpretation**
   - Script looked for `chapters.title` directly
   - But `chapters` is an array: `chapters[0].title`, `chapters[1].title`, etc.
   - Arrays were actually complete and properly structured

2. **Nested Array Handling**
   - Script couldn't handle nested arrays properly
   - Manual verification confirmed all arrays are complete

### Resolution

✅ **Advanced Script Created** - Properly handles arrays  
✅ **Manual Verification** - Confirmed all arrays are complete  
✅ **Final Status** - **0 missing keys** confirmed
