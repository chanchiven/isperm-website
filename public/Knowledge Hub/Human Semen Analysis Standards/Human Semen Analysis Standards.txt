Global Standards for Human Semen Analysis: A Comparative Guide (WHO 6th, ISO 23162, ESHRE, & ASRM)

In 2021, the landscape of human andrology was redefined by the dual release of the WHO 6th Edition Manual and the ISO 23162:2021 standard. These documents have moved the field toward rigorous standardization, emphasizing that accuracy is only possible through strict quality control and the reduction of human subjectivity.
1. Pre-analytical Phase: The Baseline of Quality
Standardization begins before the sample reaches the microscope. Both WHO 6th and ISO 23162 emphasize that pre-analytical variables are the most common cause of "false" sub-fertility results.
Abstinence Period: Standardized at 2 to 7 days. ASRM notes that while longer abstinence increases volume and count, it significantly reduces motility and increases DNA fragmentation (DFI).
Collection: Must be performed into a container pre-validated for the Human Sperm Survival Assay (HSSA).
Macroscopic Assessment: Volume must be measured with high precision. ISO 23162 recommends measuring by weight (assuming a density of 1.0 g/mL) to avoid the "wall-sticking" loss associated with pipettes or graduated cylinders.
pH: The lower limit remains 7.2. Values below this, combined with low volume, may indicate obstructive issues (e.g., CBAVD).

2. Sperm Concentration and Total Count: The Quantitative Metric
The quantitative assessment of sperm production is a primary predictor of fertility potential.
A. Concentration vs. Total Sperm Number
Sperm Concentration: The number of sperm per milliliter. WHO 6th lower limit: 16 × 10⁶/mL.
Total Sperm Number: The total count per entire ejaculate (WHO 6th lower limit: 39 × 10⁶).
Clinical Value: ASRM and ESHRE emphasize that Total Sperm Number is a more robust indicator of testicular health than concentration alone, as it accounts for the entire reproductive output.
B. The "Gold Standard" Equipment (ISO 23162 vs. Others)
Improved Neubauer Hemocytometer: Both WHO 6th and ISO 23162 mandate this as the only acceptable manual counting chamber.
Rejection of Fixed-Depth Chambers: A major point of divergence. ISO 23162 strictly prohibits the use of fixed-depth chambers (e.g., Makler or Leja slides) for definitive concentration assessment because their high Coefficient of Variation (CV) does not meet international precision standards.
Replicate Counting: ISO 23162 requires two separate replicates (counting at least 200 sperm each). If the results of the two counts do not align within a specific statistical range (Poisson distribution), the test must be repeated.
3. Sperm Motility: Measuring Progressive Competence
Motility is the measure of "vital energy." WHO 6th simplified classification to reduce the high inter-observer variability found in previous editions.
A. The Three-Category Classification
The previous 4-grade system (A, B, C, D) has been replaced by a more objective 3-category system:
Progressive Motility (PR): Sperm moving actively, either linearly or in a large circle, regardless of speed.
Non-progressive Motility (NP): Movement with no progression (e.g., swimming in small circles, or only head/tail vibrating).
Immotility (IM): No movement at all.
Reference Value: WHO 6th requires ≥30% Progressive (PR) or ≥42% Total Motility (PR + NP).
B. The Thermal Requirement (The "Life-Like" Environment)
ISO 23162 Mandate: Sperm motility is highly temperature-dependent. ISO 23162 requires analysis to be performed at 37°C.
Clinical Rationale: Analyzing at room temperature (20-22°C) causes sperm metabolism to slow down, resulting in "falsely" low progressive motility scores. Integrated heating stages (like those found in the SQA-6100VET) are essential for compliance with this standard.
4. Sperm Morphology: The "Strict Criteria"
Morphology provides the deepest insight into the biological "quality control" of the testes.
A. Kruger Strict Criteria (The 4% Rule)
All standards converge on the Kruger (Strict) Criteria. A sperm is only "Normal" if it is essentially perfect. Any "borderline" sperm is categorized as abnormal.
Normal Threshold: ≥4%.
Head/Tail Anatomy: Specific dimensions for head length (3.7–4.7 μm) and acrosome size (40–70% of the head area) are required.
B. The Teratozoospermia Index (TZI)
WHO 6th recommends calculating the TZI, which is the average number of defects per abnormal sperm. A high TZI is a marker of significant spermatogenesis dysfunction, even if the total normal percentage is above 4%.
C. Clinical Application (IVF vs. ICSI)
ASRM and ESHRE clarify that morphology's greatest clinical utility is in selecting the mode of fertilization. If morphology is <4%, laboratories often shift from standard IVF to ICSI (Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection) to ensure the best-looking sperm are manually selected for fertilization.

5. Summary Table: Comparing WHO 5th and WHO 6th Standards
This table outlines the key "Lower Reference Limits" (5th percentile) for human semen.
Parameter	WHO 5th Ed (2010)	WHO 6th Ed (2021)
Semen Volume (mL)	1.5	1.4
Total Sperm Number (10⁶/ejaculate)	39	39
Sperm Concentration (10⁶/mL)	15	16
Total Motility (PR + NP, %)	40	42
Progressive Motility (PR, %)	32	30
Vitality (Live Sperm, %)	58	54
Normal Morphology (%)	4	4

6. Laboratory Quality Assurance (ISO 23162 Central Focus)
Compliance with ISO 23162 requires more than just following the WHO manual; it requires documented proof of precision.
Intra-observer CV: Technicians must prove they can count the same sample twice and get the same result within a 10% margin of error.
External Quality Assessment (EQA): Labs must participate in global proficiency testing (like ESHRE or CAP programs) to compare their results against other standardized labs.
Standardized Reporting: Reports should clearly state which standards were followed and include the reference ranges for each parameter to aid clinician interpretation.
Conclusion: The Path to Precision
The modernization of human semen analysis is defined by a shift away from "technician's intuition" toward objective, automated, and temperature-controlled methodologies. By adhering to the combined requirements of WHO 6th and ISO 23162, laboratories ensure the highest level of diagnostic accuracy, providing patients with a reliable roadmap for their fertility journey.
