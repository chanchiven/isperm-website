The Professional Guide to Stallion Semen Analysis: Clinical Standards for Equine Breeding Soundness (EBSE)

Chapter 1: Stallion Selection and Reproductive Behavior
The evaluation of a stallion begins with his genetic pedigree and a thorough assessment of his reproductive behavior. In the equine industry, a stallion must possess a strong, controllable libido. We evaluate the stallion’s response to a "tease mare," looking for immediate interest, vocalization, and penile erection. Unlike other species, stallions are highly sensitive to their environment; stress or poor handling in the breeding shed can lead to psychological inhibitions that manifest as a refusal to mount.
Behavioral soundness also includes the ability to safely mount either a live mare or a "phantom" (breeding dummy). We monitor the stallion’s coordination and his ability to achieve a "flag" (the rhythmic pulsing of the tail), which indicates successful ejaculation. This chapter establishes that the stallion’s mental readiness and behavioral drive are the prerequisites for laboratory analysis. A stallion with elite semen quality is functionally useless for natural or AI service if he cannot be safely and effectively collected.
Chapter 2: Physical Examination and Athletic Soundness
Stallions are reproductive athletes. To successfully mount and ejaculate, they require immense strength in their hindquarters and a stable lumbosacral spine. The physical examination focuses on identifying any musculoskeletal issues, such as arthritis, hock pain, or previous tendon injuries, that might prevent the stallion from supporting his weight during a mount. Chronic pain is a significant suppressor of libido and can lead to aggressive or defensive behavior.
General health is also evaluated, including a Body Condition Score (BCS), with an ideal target of 5.0 to 6.0 on a 9-point scale. Over-conditioned stallions are prone to laminitis and cardiovascular stress, while under-conditioned stallions lack the energy reserves for a full breeding season. We also examine the stallion’s vision and respiratory health. This chapter emphasizes that the stallion must be physically "sound" to Navigatge the breeding shed; if the "vehicle" is broken, the genetic cargo cannot be delivered.
Chapter 3: Examination of Scrotum and Testicular Integrity
The stallion’s testes are oriented horizontally in a relatively tight scrotum. During clinical palpation, we assess symmetry, size, and consistency. Healthy equine testes should be smooth, firm, and resilient—similar to the feel of a ripe plum. We pay close attention to Testicular Tone; softness is often an early indicator of testicular degeneration, which is common in older stallions or those recovering from systemic illness.
The scrotum must be thin-skinned and freely movable. We check for any signs of scrotal edema or dermatitis, as even minor inflammation can disrupt the delicate thermoregulatory balance. Stallion sperm production is highly sensitive to heat; any condition that raises the scrotal temperature will lead to a rapid increase in sperm abnormalities. This chapter provides the tactile standards for identifying "factory-level" defects. If the testes lack symmetry or tone, the stallion’s sperm-producing parenchyma is likely compromised.
Chapter 4: Scrotal Width and Predicted Sperm Output
In equine andrology, Total Scrotal Width (TSW) is the most repeatable and reliable objective measurement. We use calipers to measure the width of both testes together at their widest point. TSW is a direct predictor of the stallion's Daily Sperm Output (DSO). For a mature stallion (over 4 years old), we expect a minimum TSW of 8.0 cm, with elite sires often exceeding 10.0 cm.
Unlike cattle, where circumference is measured, the horizontal orientation of equine testes makes width the more accurate metric. We use these dimensions to calculate the stallion’s expected sperm production. If a stallion’s actual ejaculate concentration is significantly lower than his predicted DSO, we investigate issues like "incomplete ejaculation" or "blocked ampullae." This chapter focuses on the mathematical quantification of the stallion’s production capacity, allowing for the strategic management of his breeding book.
Chapter 5: Internal Reproductive Glands (The Accessory Glands)
The internal examination of the stallion is performed via transrectal palpation and ultrasound. We focus on the prostate, seminal vesicles (vesicular glands), and ampullae. Stallions produce a significant amount of seminal fluid, and the vesicular glands are responsible for the "gel fraction" of the ejaculate. We look for any signs of Seminal Vesiculitis, which introduces inflammatory cells (pus) into the semen, killing sperm and reducing fertility.
We also examine the Ampullae for blockages. "Ampullary Plug" is a common condition in stallions with low ejaculation frequency, where dead sperm accumulate and block the passage of new cells. This results in an ejaculate with zero sperm or only dead sperm. This chapter highlights the "internal plumbing" of the stallion; because these glands provide the medium for sperm transport, their health is vital for the survival of the sperm during cooled or frozen storage.
Chapter 6: Penile Anatomy and Hygiene
The stallion’s penis is a large, musculocavernous organ that requires regular hygienic maintenance. We examine the Glans Penis and the Urethral Process for any signs of trauma, warts (papillomas), or SCC (Squamous Cell Carcinoma). A major focus is the Preputial Diverticulum (The Bean); we check for the accumulation of "smegma" (dried secretions and debris) which can harbor bacteria and cause irritation.
Before collection, the penis must be washed with warm water (no soap, as detergents are spermicidal). We ensure the penis can be fully extended and that there is no evidence of paraphimosis (inability to retract). This chapter ensures that the delivery system is clean and anatomically functional, preventing the introduction of pathogens into the mare or the collection vessel.
Chapter 7: Semen Collection and Temperature Sensitivity
Semen collection in stallions is performed using an Artificial Vagina (AV)—typically the Missouri or Colorado models. The AV must be carefully prepared to match the stallion’s preference for Temperature (45°C–50°C) and Pressure. If the AV is too cold, the stallion will not ejaculate; if it is too hot, the sperm will be instantly killed (thermal shock).
We emphasize "Sample Stewardship." Stallion sperm are notoriously sensitive to environmental shock. The collection bottle must be pre-warmed and protected from sunlight. We also utilize an inline filter to remove the "gel fraction" from the semen immediately after ejaculation, as the gel can interfere with motility and processing. This chapter establishes the rigorous laboratory entrance protocols required to harvest a high-quality, representative sample.
Chapter 8: Sperm Quality — The Cooled-Shipped Standard
This is the scientific heart of equine andrology. Because most sport horse breeding relies on transport, we evaluate semen not just for immediate motility, but for Longevity.
Progressive Motility: The SFT standard for a "Satisfactory" stallion is >60% progressive motility in the raw ejaculate.
Cooled Motility: We dilute the semen with a specialized Extender and test the motility again at 24 and 48 hours (stored at 4°C). If the motility drops below 30% after 24 hours, the stallion is considered a "poor cooler."
This chapter emphasizes that in the modern equine industry, motility is a measure of "transportability." At isperm.com, we advocate for digital analysis to remove the subjectivity from these critical motility assessments.
Chapter 9: Sperm Morphology and Cellular Integrity
Morphology is assessed using Eosin-Nigrosin staining under 1000x oil-immersion microscopy. We count at least 100 to 200 cells, looking for head defects (pyriform, microcephalic) and tail defects (coiled, bent). The SFT standard requires >70% normal morphology.
We pay special attention to the Acrosome. If the acrosome is damaged, the sperm cannot penetrate the egg. We also look for "Proximal Droplets," which indicate a maturation failure in the epididymis. This chapter delves into the "micro-architecture" of the cell. A stallion with high motility but poor morphology will have a low conception rate because his sperm can swim but lack the genetic or enzymatic competence to fertilize.
Chapter 10: Venereal Disease and Biosecurity
The final chapter addresses the biosecurity risks inherent in the equine industry. We monitor for Contagious Equine Metritis (CEM), a highly contagious bacterial disease that can be carried asymptomatically by the stallion. We also test for Equine Viral Arteritis (EVA), which can be shed in the semen and cause abortions in pregnant mares.
We maintain strict protocols for cleaning equipment and testing all sires before the breeding season. This chapter reinforces that a "Satisfactory Potential Breeder" must also be a "Safe Breeder." A stallion with elite genetics is a major liability if he introduces venereal disease into a multi-million dollar mare population or an international semen distribution network.
The "Thermal Integrity" Advantage for Stallions
One of the most critical engineering features of the SQA-6100VET for the equine industry is its internal, real-time heating stage.
The Challenge: Stallion sperm are exceptionally sensitive to "Cold Shock." In a typical lab, the room temperature is ~20°C, while the stallion’s body is ~38°C. This 18-degree drop causes the sperm plasma membrane to transition from a fluid to a crystalline state, resulting in a sudden, permanent loss of motility.
The Advantage: The SQA-6100VET features an integrated heating stage that maintains a constant 37°C–38°C environment throughout the analysis.
The Result: This ensures that the stallion's progressive motility is measured under "life-like" conditions. Without this built-in heater, a fertile stallion could be incorrectly labeled as sub-fertile simply because his sperm "crashed" on a cold microscope slide. For high-value thoroughbred and sport horse sires, this feature is the ultimate insurance policy for diagnostic accuracy.
