Ram Breeding Soundness Examination (RBSE) 
Chapter 1: Seasonality, Photoperiod, and Puberty
One of the most critical factors in ram fertility that distinguishes it from other livestock is its intense seasonality. Rams are "short-day" breeders; their reproductive endocrine system is governed by the photoperiod. As day length decreases in the fall, melatonin production increases, triggering a surge in GnRH, FSH, and LH. This physiological shift results in a dramatic increase in testicular size, libido, and sperm quality. Conversely, during the spring and summer (non-breeding season), rams may experience "seasonal atrophy," where sperm production drops significantly. Therefore, an RBSE must be performed within 6 to 8 weeks before the intended breeding season to be clinically valid.
Puberty in rams typically occurs between 5 and 7 months of age, depending on the breed and plane of nutrition. However, we caution producers against making final culling decisions on ram lambs before they reach 10–12 months of age. During this first year, we establish a "baseline" of reproductive health, monitoring the transition from the prepubertal state to full spermatogenesis. We also evaluate the Body Condition Score (BCS), aiming for a score of 3.0 to 3.5 on a 5-point scale. A ram must have adequate energy reserves to endure the high physical demands of the "rut," but over-conditioning must be avoided, as excessive fat in the inguinal area interferes with the thermal regulation of the testes, leading to poor semen quality.
Chapter 2: Physical Examination and Athletic Integrity
In the ram industry, we often say that "fertility starts with the feet." A ram must be a superior athlete to navigate rugged terrain, identify ewes in estrus, and mount dozens of times per day. The physical examination begins with a thorough assessment of the Musculoskeletal System. We scrutinize the hooves and joints for signs of foot rot, arthritis, or structural faults like "post-leggedness." Any condition that causes lameness will lead to a refusal to mount, effectively rendering the ram sterile in a natural service environment, regardless of his semen quality.
Beyond the limbs, we evaluate the sensory organs. Vision is paramount, as rams rely heavily on visual cues to detect "estrous groups" in a flock. We also examine the mouth and teeth, especially in older rams, to ensure they can maintain their body condition during the breeding season. Any sign of chronic disease, such as Caseous Lymphadenitis (CL) or respiratory distress, is a cause for concern. The physical exam serves as the foundational "fitness-for-duty" check; if the ram lacks the mobility to pursue ewes, the laboratory analysis of his sperm becomes a secondary consideration.
Chapter 3: Examination of Scrotum and Testicular Tone
The scrotum of the ram is a highly evolved thermoregulatory organ. During our clinical palpation, we look for symmetry, resilience, and mobility. The testes should be identical in size and shape, hanging freely within the scrotal sac without adhesions. We describe the ideal consistency of a fertile ram's testis as "resilient"—firm like a tensed muscle, but with a palpable elasticity. If the testes feel soft or "mushy," it is a classic sign of testicular degeneration or heat stress. Conversely, a stone-hard testis may indicate chronic fibrosis or calcification from a past injury.
The scrotal skin must be thin, pliable, and free of lesions. We specifically check for Chorioptic Mange, which can cause severe dermatitis and thickening of the scrotal skin. Thickened skin acts as insulation, preventing the "counter-current" heat exchange mechanism from cooling the testes. Because spermatogenesis in the ram requires a temperature 4–6°C lower than core body temperature, even a slight increase in scrotal surface temperature can cause a massive increase in sperm head and tail abnormalities. This chapter emphasizes the "tactile diagnostic" phase, where the clinician’s hands provide the first real insight into the ram's sperm-producing parenchyma.
Chapter 4: Scrotal Circumference (SC) — The Metric of Fertility
In the RBSE, Scrotal Circumference (SC) is the most powerful and repeatable objective measurement we have. It is highly correlated with both testicular weight and Daily Sperm Production (DSP). According to SFT standards, the minimum SC for a ram is determined by his age and the time of year. For most breeds, we expect a minimum of 30 cm for a yearling and 34 cm or more for a mature ram during the breeding season. Rams with larger SC values not only produce more sperm but also tend to have a higher percentage of motile, normal sperm.
The importance of SC extends to the entire flock’s genetics. There is a strong, proven correlation between a ram’s SC and the reproductive performance of his female offspring. Ewes sired by rams with large SC reach puberty earlier and are more likely to exhibit multiple ovulations (twinning). Therefore, when we measure SC using a standardized Coulter tape, we are not just evaluating the ram's current capacity to impregnate ewes; we are selecting for the future prolificacy of the herd. Precision is vital: the testes must be pulled firmly into the bottom of the scrotum, and the tape must be applied at the widest point without indenting the skin.
Chapter 5: The Epididymis and Brucella Ovis Screening
Chapter 5 focuses on the "storage and maturation" center—the epididymis. In rams, this is the most critical part of the clinical exam due to the prevalence of Epididymitis, most commonly caused by Brucella ovis. We pay meticulous attention to the Tail (Cauda) of the epididymis. It should be large, firm, and distinct from the testis. Any enlargement, lack of symmetry, or "stony" hardness is a pathognomonic sign of infection. B. ovis is a devastating venereal disease that can lead to permanent infertility in the ram and reproductive failure in the ewe flock.
Beyond B. ovis, other organisms like Histophilus somni can cause "lamb epididymitis." During palpation, any pain or swelling suggests an active inflammatory process. If the epididymal tail is compromised, the sperm cannot undergo the final maturation process required for motility and fertilization. As an andrologist, I consider this chapter the "Biosecurity Guard" of the RBSE. If a ram fails the epididymal palpation, he is classified as a significant risk to the flock and should be isolated immediately for serological testing.
Chapter 6: Penile and Preputial Integrity
The delivery system of the ram has a unique anatomical feature: the Urethral Process (Filiform Appendage). This small, hair-like extension at the tip of the penis plays a role in spraying semen across the external os of the cervix during ejaculation. During the exam, we must ensure that this process is intact and free of inflammation. A common issue we encounter is "Urolithiasis" (urinary stones), where the urethral process is often removed to allow the passage of a stone. While the ram can still ejaculate without it, his fertility in a natural mating scenario may be reduced.
We also examine the prepuce for signs of Ulcerative Posthitis, commonly known as "Pizzle Rot." This condition is caused by urea-splitting bacteria (Corynebacterium renale) and is exacerbated by high-protein diets. It leads to painful ulcers and scabs that can prevent the ram from extending his penis. We also check for "pizzle sores" or shearing injuries. Any trauma to the penis or prepuce that causes pain will lead to a refusal to mount. This chapter ensures that the "mechanical" aspect of mating is functional and that the ram is not experiencing discomfort during intromission.
Chapter 7: Semen Collection — Handling High-Density Samples
Semen collection in the ram can be achieved through the Artificial Vagina (AV) or Electroejaculation (EE). The AV is ideal for trained rams and provides a sample that truly represents natural mating quality. However, for most field evaluations of range rams, EE is the standard. We emphasize that ram semen is exceptionally concentrated—one of the most dense in the animal kingdom, with concentrations often reaching 2 to 5 billion sperm per milliliter.
Because the volume is so small (0.5 to 2.0 ml) and the density so high, the sample is extremely vulnerable to environmental shock. We insist that all collection tubes and slides are pre-warmed to 37°C. Exposure to "cold shock" for even a few seconds will cause the sperm to lose motility, leading to an incorrect diagnosis of infertility. We also protect the sample from direct sunlight and water contamination. For a laboratory using digital tools like the iSperm system, this chapter is about "Sample Stewardship"—ensuring that the high-quality cells produced by the ram arrive at the analysis stage in their true physiological state.
Chapter 8: Evaluation of Semen Quality — The Wave and the Cell
Due to the extreme concentration of ram semen, the laboratory evaluation follows a specific hierarchy.
Gross Motility: We first look at the "swirl" or "wave" motion under low power (40x). A "Very Good" rating is given to samples with rapid, dark, swirling clouds.
Individual Progressive Motility: The sample must be diluted (usually with warmed saline or extender) to see individual cells. The SFT minimum for a "Satisfactory" rating is 30% progressive motility.
Morphology: We require at least 70% normal morphology. We use an Eosin-Nigrosin stain to identify head, midpiece, and tail defects.
Common defects in rams include "detached heads" or "coiled tails," which can be temporary signs of heat stress. Because ram sperm are "fast and dense," manual counting is notoriously difficult and prone to high error rates. This is where automated systems become essential, as they can handle the required high dilution rates while providing an objective count of millions of cells.
Chapter 9: Final Classification and the 60-Day Retest
The RBSE concludes with a clinical classification. A ram is either:
Satisfactory Potential Breeder: He has passed all physical, SC, and semen thresholds.
Unsatisfactory Potential Breeder: He has a permanent defect, such as a B. ovis infection or testicular atrophy.
Classification Deferred: This is common for rams that have recently suffered from a fever, foot rot, or extreme heat.
Because the process of spermatogenesis in the ram takes approximately 49 days, plus about 10–14 days for epididymal transit, we recommend a re-test in 60 days for any deferred ram. This allows the ram to complete a full "cycle" of sperm production. If the new sample is still poor, the condition is likely permanent. This chapter ensures that the ram owner has a clear, data-driven decision for their breeding program.
Chapter 10: Biosecurity and Brucella Ovis Management
The final chapter addresses the "silent" threat to sheep production: venereal disease. We advocate for a comprehensive biosecurity protocol where the RBSE is just one part. Brucella ovis ELISA testing should be a standard accompaniment to the physical exam. We emphasize that a "Satisfactory" ram must be more than just fertile—he must be "clean."
We also monitor the semen for Leukocytes (white blood cells). The presence of pus in the semen is a sign of infection in the accessory glands or the testes. We maintain strict protocols for introducing new rams into a flock, requiring a "double-negative" test for B. ovis spaced 60 days apart. By focusing on these health parameters, we transform the RBSE from a simple fertility test into a high-level herd health management tool. For a platform like isperm.com, Chapter 10 reinforces that digital analysis is most effective when combined with rigorous clinical and biological safety standards.
The Role of SQA-6100VET in Ram Semen Analysis
The SQA-6100VET provides specialized support for the unique challenges of ram semen:
High-Density Accuracy: Ram semen is too dense for traditional manual counting without massive error. The SQA-6100VET’s electro-optical system is optimized for these high concentrations, providing a precise TSC (Total Sperm Concentration).
Objective Progressive Motility: Human eyes often struggle to differentiate between "swirl" motion and "progressive" motion in rams. The SQA-6100VET provides an unbiased MSC (Motile Sperm Concentration).
Standardized Reporting: The device generates a digital record that aligns with SFT Chapter 9 requirements, perfect for seedstock producers who need to provide "Fertility Certificates" to buyers.
Field Portability: Since many RBSEs are done on-site at the ranch, the SQA-6100VET allows for immediate, lab-grade results without transporting sensitive samples.
The "Thermal Integrity" Advantage: Why SQA-6100VET is Essential Across Species
One of the standout engineering features of the SQA-6100VET is its internal, real-time heating stage. In the world of andrology, "Motility is Temperature." If the analysis environment does not match the animal's physiological state, the data is clinically invalid.
The Challenge: Ram semen is extremely concentrated (up to 5 billion/mL). High-density samples lose heat rapidly due to their small volume.
The Advantage: Because ram sperm are so dense, they "crash" (stop moving) the moment they hit a cold slide. The SQA-6100VET’s built-in heater keeps the sample at peak metabolic activity, allowing for a true assessment of the "Swirl" and "Wave" motion.
