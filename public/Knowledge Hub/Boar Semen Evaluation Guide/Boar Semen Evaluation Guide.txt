Boar Semen Evaluation and Processing Standards and Boar Breeding Soundness Examination (BBSE)

Chapter 1: Selection and Puberty — The Genetic Foundation
The journey of a high-performance sire begins with selection. Unlike cattle, where natural service is still common, the modern boar is almost exclusively an Artificial Insemination (AI) donor. We prioritize selection based on three pillars: genetic merit, structural soundness, and reproductive potential. Puberty in boars typically occurs between 5 and 7 months of age, but we insist that a boar must be at least 8 months old before being entered into a full-scale AI production rotation.
The heritability of reproductive traits is a critical consideration. While traits like growth rate and backfat are easily measured, we focus on the heritability of "fertility markers" such as age at puberty and testicular size. A boar that reaches sexual maturity early often produces daughters with superior reproductive longevity.[1] During the selection phase, we also evaluate the Body Condition Score (BCS). A boar must enter the stud with an ideal BCS of 3 (on a 5-point scale). Over-conditioned boars are prone to leg injuries and "heat stress" from excessive fat in the scrotal area, which can lead to permanent damage to the germinal epithelium. This chapter serves as the "pre-check" to ensure that only the most resilient and genetically capable males enter the intensive environment of an AI center.
Chapter 2: Physical Examination — Skeletal and Sensory Integrity
In swine, structural soundness is not just a preference; it is a clinical necessity. Because boars must mount a collection dummy (phantom) hundreds of times throughout their lives, their musculoskeletal system must be flawless. We pay particular attention to the "conformation of the feet and legs." Issues such as "bucked knees," "straight hocks," or "splay-footedness" are not merely aesthetic faults—they lead to chronic lameness, which is the number one cause of premature culling in boar studs. A boar in pain will have suppressed testosterone levels and decreased libido.
Sensory health is equally vital. The boar uses a combination of visual and olfactory cues to identify the collection environment.[1] Any sign of vision impairment or nasal inflammation can interfere with the boar’s ability to recognize the "pheromonal triggers" required for sexual arousal. We also examine the integumentary system, looking for signs of mange or skin lesions that could indicate a systemic health issue. The physical exam is the "gatekeeper" phase; if a boar cannot walk comfortably or see his environment, his semen quality is irrelevant because he will eventually refuse to mount.
Chapter 3: Genital Organ Examination — Testes and Scrotum
The testes are the "production facility," and their size is directly correlated with daily sperm production (DSP). During a BBSE, we palpate the testes for symmetry, tone, and size. The testes should be firm and elastic—similar to the consistency of a ripe orange. Soft testes are a hallmark of degeneration, which can be caused by fever, environmental heat, or toxins. We insist on symmetry; a difference of more than 1 cm in testicular width often indicates an underlying pathology such as a tumor, cyst, or past infection (orchitis).
Temperature regulation in the boar is less efficient than in the bull, making them extremely sensitive to heat stress. The scrotum must be clean, free of lesions, and capable of moving the testes away from the body during warm periods. We use "Total Scrotal Width" as a measurable benchmark. In mature boars (over 10 months), a scrotal width of less than 15-18 cm (depending on breed) is often a sign of insufficient sperm-producing parenchyma. This chapter emphasizes that the external examination of the genitals is a predictive tool: we are not just looking at the current state, but assessing the boar's long-term capacity to meet the high-volume demands of a commercial AI stud.
Chapter 4: Libido and Behavioral Evaluation — Sexual Motivation
Libido in the boar is a complex interplay of hormones and learned behavior. A boar with "high libido" is one that enters the collection pen with confidence, expresses interest in the dummy immediately, and mounts without hesitation. We evaluate the boar's "precopulatory behavior," which includes rhythmic grunting, chomping of the jaws (producing a pheromone-rich foam), and "rooting" behavior. This saliva contains the pheromone androstenol, which is critical for stimulating both the boar's own drive and the standing reflex in sows.
Behavioral "stalling" or lack of interest is often a sign of poor management or underlying physical pain. We categorize boars by their "Serving Capacity"—the time it takes from entering the pen to a successful mount. A boar that takes more than 10 minutes to mount is considered a "slow breeder," which reduces the efficiency of the stud. It is important to remember that libido is largely independent of semen quality; a boar can have perfect sperm but zero interest in the dummy. This chapter focuses on the psychological readiness of the boar, ensuring that he is a reliable and "willing" participant in the AI process.
Chapter 5: Semen Collection — The Gloved-Hand Technique
The "Gloved-Hand Technique" is the universal standard for boar semen collection. Unlike the artificial vagina used for bulls, boars respond to "digital pressure" applied to the corkscrew-shaped tip of the penis. We emphasize the use of Vinyl Gloves, as latex can be spermicidal. The collection process is divided into phases: the pre-sperm fraction, the sperm-rich fraction, and the post-sperm fraction. We instruct collectors to "divert" the pre-sperm fraction (which is clear and high in bacterial load) and only collect the milky, sperm-rich portion.[2]
Contamination is the greatest enemy during collection. The "preputial pouch" in the boar contains fluids that are highly toxic to sperm and loaded with bacteria. We use a "double-glove" technique: the first glove is used to evacuate the preputial pouch and stimulate the boar, and the second (clean) glove is used to grasp the penis once it is extended. The use of a filter over the collection thermos is mandatory to remove the "gel plug" (secretion from the bulbourethral glands), which would otherwise coagulate and interfere with processing.[3] This chapter is the "sanitary foundation" of the entire AI operation.
Chapter 6: Initial Semen Evaluation — Volume and Concentration
Once the ejaculate is in the lab, we perform a macroscopic evaluation. A normal boar ejaculate is voluminous, ranging from 150 ml to over 400 ml. The color should be "milky white" to "creamy." Any yellow tint suggests urine contamination, which is instantly spermicidal. A watery appearance indicates a low sperm concentration. Odor is also a diagnostic tool; boar semen should be relatively odorless. A foul or "putrid" smell is a clear sign of infection in the accessory glands.
Quantifying Concentration is the most critical step for the economics of the boar stud. Because one ejaculate can be diluted to create 20 to 50 "doses" of semen, an error in measuring concentration can lead to either wasted genetics (under-dilution) or failed pregnancies (over-dilution). We move away from subjective "opacity" tests and insist on objective measurements using a photometer or automated cell counter. This chapter transitions from the "art" of clinical observation to the "science" of laboratory measurement, setting the stage for precise AI dose calculation.
Chapter 7: Sperm Motility — The 70% Progressive Standard
Motility is the most common metric for "passing" or "failing" an ejaculate. In the swine industry, our "gold standard" threshold is 70% Progressive Motility. Sperm that are swimming in circles, twitching, or moving backward are not counted. We look for "forward-progressing" cells that demonstrate the vigor required to traverse the long uterine horns of the sow.
Environmental control is paramount here. Boar sperm are notoriously sensitive to "cold shock." We require all slides, extenders, and tubes to be maintained at 37°C. We also evaluate "Longevity Motility"—testing the semen 24, 48, and 72 hours after extension to see how well it survives the storage process. If motility drops below 60% after 24 hours, the boar is flagged for investigation. This chapter emphasizes that while motility does not guarantee fertility, it is a mandatory prerequisite. If the sperm can't "swim," they can't "win."
Chapter 8: Sperm Morphology — The 80% Normal Threshold
Morphology is the most reliable predictor of farrowing rate and litter size. While motility shows the sperm are alive, morphology shows they are "competent." Our standard is that an ejaculate must contain at least 80% normal sperm cells. We use high-resolution phase-contrast microscopy or specialized stains (like Eosin-Nigrosin) to identify defects. We pay close attention to Cytoplasmic Droplets. A high percentage of "proximal droplets" (near the head) usually indicates that the boar is being over-collected and the sperm are being "harvested" before they can fully mature in the epididymis.
Other critical defects include "coiled tails," "pear-shaped heads," and "acrosome damage." The acrosome is the "enzyme cap" that allows the sperm to penetrate the egg; if the acrosome is damaged, the sperm can reach the egg but cannot fertilize it. This chapter focuses on the "micro-integrity" of the cell. We emphasize that a boar with 90% motility but 40% abnormal morphology is a "high-risk" sire that will likely cause small litter sizes or high "return-to-heat" rates in the herd.
Chapter 9: Semen Processing and Extension — The AI Dose
Boar semen is rarely used "raw." It is diluted with an extender to provide nutrients, maintain pH, and control bacterial growth. This process allows us to turn a single ejaculate into multiple doses. The "standard dose" in the industry is typically 2 to 3 billion motile sperm in a volume of 60 to 80 ml. The dilution must be done carefully: we always add the extender to the semen, not the other way around, and both liquids must be within 1°C of each other to avoid osmotic shock.
Cooling is the final step in processing. Extended semen is gradually cooled to a "storage temperature" of 16°C to 18°C. If the temperature drops below 15°C, the lipids in the sperm membrane can crystallize, causing irreversible damage. If it stays above 20°C, bacterial growth will skyrocket and the sperm will exhaust their energy reserves too quickly. This chapter is about "stabilizing" the genetic cargo, ensuring that the sperm remain viable for 3 to 5 days (or even longer with long-term extenders) while being transported to the farm.
Chapter 10: Biosecurity and Disease Management — Protecting the Herd
A boar stud is the "heart" of a production system; if it becomes infected, the disease is spread to every farm in the network via the semen. This chapter addresses the "Biological Safety" of the boar.[1][3][4] The most significant threat is PRRS (Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome), which can be shed in semen before the boar shows any clinical signs. We require all boars to be tested via PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) on a weekly basis.
Other diseases of concern include Brucellosis, Pseudorabies, and African Swine Fever (ASF). We maintain strict "closed-stud" policies, with rigorous quarantine (acclimatization) periods for new arrivals. We also monitor for bacterial contamination during processing. The use of antibiotics in extenders is a standard practice, but we must ensure that the bacteria in the stud are not resistant to these drugs. This final chapter reinforces that fertility is not just about "numbers"—it is about "safety." A highly fertile boar that is PRRS-positive is a biological disaster.

The Role of SQA-6100VET in Boar Semen Analysis
According to the standards outlined in these 10 chapters, the SQA-6100VET serves as the vital "analytical bridge" between raw collection and the production of a high-quality AI dose.
Standardization of Concentration (Chapter 6): The SQA-6100VET eliminates the "human factor" in dose calculation. By providing a precise Total Sperm Concentration (TSC), it ensures that every dose contains exactly the 2-3 billion sperm required, protecting the stud’s profitability.
Objective Motility Analysis (Chapter 7): Instead of a technician "guessing" the motility, the device measures MSC (Motile Sperm Concentration) and PMS (Progressive Motile Sperm). It tracks velocity parameters (VAP, VSL), which are early indicators of sperm stress that a human eye might miss.
High-Throughput Speed: In a commercial boar stud processing 50-100 boars in a morning, the SQA-6100VET’s 15-second test time is a game-changer for efficiency.
Data Integrity (Chapter 9): Every test is recorded and can be printed as a "Fertility Certificate." This provides a verifiable trail of quality for the sow farms, increasing trust in the boar stud's product.
The "Thermal Integrity" Advantage: Why SQA-6100VET is Essential Across Species
One of the standout engineering features of the SQA-6100VET is its internal, real-time heating stage. In the world of andrology, "Motility is Temperature." If the analysis environment does not match the animal's physiological state, the data is clinically invalid.
The Challenge: Swine sperm have a high ratio of unsaturated fatty acids in their membranes, making them the most "temperature-fragile" of all livestock species.
The Advantage: Even a 2-degree drop can cause boar sperm to "clump" or stop moving. The real-time temperature control of the SQA-6100VET ensures that the 70% Motility threshold is recorded accurately, allowing for the precise dilution.
