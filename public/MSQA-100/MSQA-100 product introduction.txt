MSQA-100 Portable CASA Semen Analyzer
The MSQA-100 is a portable, home-use Computer-Assisted Sperm Analysis (CASA) system designed for fast, accurate, and user-friendly semen evaluation. By combining microfluidic technology, precision manufacturing, and AI-driven image analysis, the MSQA-100 delivers laboratory-level performance in a compact and accessible format.
Key Technologies & Features
Microfluidic Slide 
The proprietary microfluidic slide creates a 7 μm fixed observation chamber when two layers are assembled. This fixed-depth design eliminates the need for manual focusing and ensures consistent, reproducible results.
Universal Smartphone & Tablet Compatibility
Compatible with almost all mainstream smartphone and tablet rear cameras, enabling flexible and low-cost imaging without dedicated microscopes.
Built-in Temperature Control
Integrated thermal module maintains samples at 37°C during analysis, preserving sperm motility and ensuring physiologically accurate results.
Ultra-Microfluidic Polymer Biochip
Cloud-Based AI Analysis
Powered by a cloud server Gaussian dynamic image intelligent algorithm for accurate and automated data processing.
Automatic Focus Microscopic Vision System
Fully Automated Analysis
Minimal user operation, suitable for both professional and home settings.
