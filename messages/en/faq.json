In canine andrology, puberty typically occurs between 6 and 12 months, depending on the breed (larger breeds often mature later). However, we generally recommend that a full Breeding Soundness Examination (BSE) not be considered definitive until the dog is at least 18 to 24 months old. Peak fertility in the domestic dog is usually observed between the ages of 2 and 5 years.",

A dog's libido is highly influenced by his social environment and previous breeding experiences. In this chapter, we establish that the \"biological window\" for a stud dog is finite; as a dog ages beyond 7 years, we expect a natural decline in sperm concentration and an increase in morphological defects. Establishing a baseline of fertility early in a dog's career is essential for long-term reproductive management."

The technician applies a rhythmic massage to the abdominal muscles while simultaneously stimulating the base of the tail. This triggers the eversion of the phallus (a small, non-intromittent organ) and the ejaculation of semen."

Testosterone levels skyrocket, and the \"poll glands\" (occipital glands) on the back of the neck become highly active, secreting a dark, pungent-smelling fluid used for territorial marking."

A physical examination must begin with the camel's ability to \"cush\" (sit) and rise smoothly.

The testes of a mature Dromedary are roughly 7–10 cm in length during the rut. We look for \"testicular tone\"—a healthy testis should feel resilient.

Unlike the artificial vagina used for bulls, boars respond to \"digital pressure\" applied to the corkscrew-shaped tip of the penis. We emphasize the use of Vinyl Gloves, as latex can be spermicidal. The collection process is divided into phases: the pre-sperm fraction, the sperm-rich fraction, and the post-sperm fraction. We instruct collectors to \"divert\" the pre-sperm fraction (which is clear and high in bacterial load) and only collect the milky, sperm-rich portion."

The color should be \"milky white\" to \"creamy.\" Any yellow tint suggests urine contamination, which is instantly spermicidal. A watery appearance indicates a low sperm concentration. Quantifying Concentration is the most critical step for the economics of the boar stud. Because one ejaculate can be diluted to create 20 to 50 \"doses\" of semen, an error in measuring concentration can lead to either wasted genetics (under-dilution) or failed pregnancies (over-dilution)."

Thermal Stability (The 37°C Requirement)</strong><br/><br/>Sperm motility is highly temperature-dependent. The WHO 6th Edition mandates that motility assessment be performed at 37°C.<br/><br/>The Technical Solution: Analyzers must feature a Built-in Heating Stage. External warming is insufficient; the chamber itself must maintain a physiological temperature during the actual analysis to prevent \"Cold Shock\" and false diagnoses of Asthenozoospermia.<br/><br/><strong>2. Volumetric Precision (Fixed-Depth Microfluidics)</strong><br/><br/>Concentration calculation is a function of volume. If the depth of the sample is unknown or variable, the result is invalid.<br/><br/>The Technical Solution: The use of Fixed-depth Counting Chambers (typically 10μm or 20μm) is the gold standard. Disposable, precision-engineered chambers eliminate the Z-axis errors found in standard slides and coverslips, ensuring concentration readings are accurate to within clinical margins.<br/><br/><strong>3. Objective Morphology (AI & Specialized Optics)</strong><br/><br/>Sperm morphology is perhaps the most subjective part of manual analysis. The \"Kruger Strict Criteria\" requires identifying subtle defects in the head, midpiece, and tail.<br/><br/>The Technical Solution: Because sperm cells are nearly transparent, a specialized microscope optical module is required. When paired with AI Image Algorithms, the system can automatically measure the length, width, and area of the sperm head and detect cytoplasmic residues, adhering strictly to the WHO 6th Edition morphological evaluation without human error."

CASA systems offer a significant advantage here by providing digital \"proof\" of analysis, trajectory maps, and stored images that can be reviewed during laboratory audits.<br/><br/><strong>Validation:</strong> Any automated system used in a clinical setting must undergo an initial validation process to ensure its results correlate with the laboratory's established reference methods."

The high-precision morphology data provided by AI-driven CASA systems allows for more informed decisions regarding the necessity of ICSI."
